		<h3>Context of Project Gutenberg</h3>
		<p2>Founded in 1971 by Michael Hart, who also invented ebooks by 	scanning copies of physical books, with the idea that they could be accessed from anywhere with a computer. He had first transcribed the Declaration of Independence in text form, the project expanded beyond that point to include now 75,000 different ebooks. Project Gutenberg is now a nonprofit organization, relying on volunteers and donations for their operations (scanning books, making them available). The project promotes the freedom to read as outlined by the <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/freedomreadstatement">ALA's statement</a>– having access to more literature promotes democracy and civic virtue.</p2>
		<h4>System Specifications</h3>
		<p3>Project Gutenberg is a website that provides access to many different types of eBooks. Users can browse titles by frequently downloaded items, main categories (genres), or by curated reading lists. There is also a search function (a quick search by keyword or advanced search with different filters). Project Gutenberg requires web/internet access, computer to access internet, it is also
accessible on phones. The full text of the books can be read in browser, or downloaded in different formats.
The text of the books is also accessible in plain text (.txt format), and can be sent to different e-readers</p3>
		<p4><br>Project Gutenberg emphasizes that they do not produce facsimiles of the original works, but rather making a new work, i.e. with a different format so it is easily readable and accessible. </a>
	<h4>Users</h4>
	<p5>There is a broad base of users, i.e. everyone, the public, because ebooks on Project Gutenberg are easily accessible, and can be accessed from anywhere, open to everyone. This would include educators, students, and members of the public, as they promote the ALA's right to read.</p5>
